#Code of Conduct

##Who does this apply to?

This Code of Conduct applies to all Black Codher attendees. This includes, but is not limited to, speakers, facilitators, sponsors, volunteers, venue staff, event organisers, and organisation leaders.

##What we ask of you?

We will not accept the following behaviours at Black Codher:
- Violence or threats of violence toward another person
- Discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment • Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following of anyone attending or around the event, or taking pictures of or recording them without their permission • Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact or sexual attention
- Deliberate “outing” or revealing details that are not public knowledge of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse

##What happens when the Code of Conduct is not followed?

If you are subject to any unacceptable behaviour, whether listed above or not, notice that someone else is being subject to such behaviour, or have concerns that this Code of Conduct is not being followed, notify a Black Codher team member as soon as possible or email us at team@blackcodher.com.

All reports will remain completely confidential. The Black Codher team will determine and carry out the appropriate course of action, including, but not limited to, speaking to the individual, removal from the event or banning from all future events, and will be available for the duration of the event to help an attendee experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe during that event and at future events. If requested, a follow-up report will be made to individuals who report being harassed.

##How do I give feedback on this Code of Conduct?  

If you feel like this Code of Conduct does that inadequately, or have any other feedback that supports this goal, please let us know by emailing us at team@blackcodher.com.  This is a living document that we recognise will never be “finished” and appreciate any ways we can make it clearer or more supportive of marginalised people.
