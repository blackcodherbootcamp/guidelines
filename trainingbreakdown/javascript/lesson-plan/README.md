## Unit overview

In this unit students will learn the fundamental of programming using JavaScript.

## End of unit assessment

By the end of this unit, each student should have a solid understanding of JavaScript. They will have worked in group to produce an **animated interactive timeline** using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
