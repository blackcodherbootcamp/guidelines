# Teaching Assistants
Thank you so much for signing up to be a volunteer for the Black Codher Bootcamp. Hereâ€™s a little guide for how to prepare and get the best out of this opportunity.

As a volunteer, we would like you to teaching assistant the programme by assisting our learners in progressing with their work and finding the right answers. Please help out by doing the following:

* Join our learning sessions and help out in breakout rooms

## Before the module
- Ensure you have access to [Black Codher Learning](https://learning.blackcodher.tech/)
- Review the course material for the module you will be supporting
- Assess all of the course material to make sure you are comfortable supporting the content

## Before the session
Before each session please do the following:
- Ensure you have an understanding of the material that you will be supporting
- Ensure you have the Zoom link for the session

## During the session

### At the beginning
- Remind the Instructor to Run the registration poll if it hasn't been started
- Remind the Instructor to Record the session to the cloud (recordings to the cloud end up on the Black Codher Learning platform automatically)
- Identify the other teaching assistants and volunteers present during the session
- Please update your name to Full Name (Volunteer) to make it clear to instructors and students.

### During the session
- Keep an eye on the chat in case there are any questions
- When you ask 'Red / Yellow / Green', ask the students to post their responses in the Zoom chat
  - Red: Go over the content to make it clearer or easier to digest in the chat
  - Yellow: Ask if there are any questions that the students have and answer them
  - Green: Continue

### Tasks
