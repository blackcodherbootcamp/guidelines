# Teaching Assistants
Thank you so much for signing up to be a volunteer for the Black Codher Bootcamp. Here’s a little guide for how to prepare and get the best out of this opportunity.

As a volunteer, we would like you to support the programme by assisting our learners in progressing with their work and finding the right answers. Please help out by doing the following:

* Join our learning sessions and help out in breakout rooms

## Volunteering during lessons
We will post a poll in the #general channel every week to find out who will be attending the  Black Codher sessions. If you plan to attend a session, please vote so that the instructors know who will be helping during the sessions.

As we’re currently conducting this program remotely, you will need to connect on Zoom. Once you have connected to a session, please update your name to Full Name (Volunteer) to make it clear to instructors and students.

During the sessions, please help with tasks when the learners are put in breakout rooms to complete tasks.
