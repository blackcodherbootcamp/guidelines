# Forum (Slack) Support
Thank you so much for signing up to be a volunteer for the Black Codher Bootcamp. Here’s a little guide for how to prepare and get the best out of this opportunity.

As a volunteer, we would like you to support the programme by assisting our learners in progressing with their work and finding the right answers. Please help out by doing the following:

* Keep an eye on the #i-need-help channel and answer technical questions

## How will it work?
Once you’ve signed up, you will be invited to the Black Codher slack and and added to the #black-codher-volunteers channel.
