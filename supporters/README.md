# Black Codher Support Guide

Black Codher is a 6-month part time coding bootcamp empowering black women to develop the skills and knowledge to become full stack developers.

Occassionally, Black Codher will run a 16 week part time front end development coding bootcamp.

This guidance is for all support provided to the Black Codher bootcamp.

As a Black Codher supporter you’ll be supporting the learners whilst they undertake the intensive coding bootcamp. The bootcamp is running part time with two evenings a week, and we want our learners to be supported and guided to finding the right solutions.

## Mentee / Mentor Matching

The Black Codher team pairs technical mentors to study groups(5 students). The pairing is subject-based, hence for each course unit you experience in, you will be paired with a study group.

When you are paired, we will give you the following information about the mentee in order to make contact. We will also give the mentee the same information about you.
* Name
* Email Address
* Slack Contact Details

Please let us know if you have capacity to support more than one mentee, and we will ensure that we allocate you additional mentees.

Once you’re matched up, please contact your mentee on the Black Codher slack, you and your mentee should arrange the time for your sessions.

We leave it up to you to arrange the sessions with your mentees.


## First session guidance

If you have a particular approach or mentorship / pairing style that you’d like to, please feel free to use it. Here are some suggestions to get the ball rolling on the first session:
1. Introduce yourselves
2. Outline goals and objectives
3. Discuss what you both would like out of the sessions - Set some [SMART Goals](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)
4. Discuss preferred pairing styles - It’s likely that you will be pairing during the sessions. We recommend using Visual Studio Code Live Share
5. Discuss how frequently you would like to have sessions
