# Assessors

Thank you so much for signing up to be an assessor for the Black Codher Bootcamp! Hereâ€™s a little guide for how to prepare and get the best out of this opportunity.

## Brief Breakdown

As the students progress through the course, they will be required to turn in some coding assignments/projects.

This is where **YOU** come in!

We would like you to support the programme by assessing student coding projects. We expect the following from you:

- Provide honest feedback on areas where the student excelled.
- Provide feedback on areas where the student can improve on. This could be adopting best practices, avoiding certain patterns, functionality improvement etc.

## Mode of Assessment

We use GitHub classrooms to manage the assessments and student repositories. 

The criteria for each of the assessments is listed in the READMEs:

### 1. [Command Line and Git Assessment Criteria](https://github.com/blackcodherbootcamp-assessments/unit01-assessment-git)
