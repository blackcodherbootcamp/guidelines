#Slack Workspace Guidelines

We will be using a slack channel to engage with other members of your cohort, mentors and course facilitators (teachers).  

The purpose of Slack Channel is to ensure you are informed about homework assignments, answer questions and signpost you to help and support while cultivating community.

We expect that you all will adhere to our codes of conduct virtually and physically.
